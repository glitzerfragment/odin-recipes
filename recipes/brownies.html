     <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a fabulous brownie recipe, the best that I know. The trick to getting wonderfully moist and dense brownies is to put them into cold water directly after baking. <em>Do not skip this step!</em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>250g 70% cocoa chocolate</li>
            <li>250g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>300g golden caster sugar</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, plus 1 extra egg yolk, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>60g plain flour</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>60g good quality cocoa powder</li>
            <li>100g walnuts (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat the oven to 180Â° C and line a 23cm x 23cm baking tin with baking parchment.</li>
            <li>Melt 200g of the chocolate.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, beat the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, and break the rest of the chocolate into chips.</li>
            <li>With the mixer still running, gradually beat the eggs, beating well between each addition. Mix on a high speed for five minutes until the batter has a silky sheen and has increased in volume.</li>
            <li>Gently fold in the melted chocolate and chocolate chips with a metal spoon, followed by the sifted flour, baking powder, salt, cocoa powder, and walnuts.</li>
            <li>Spoon the mixture into the tin, and bake for 30 minutes. Prepare a roasting tin of iced water.</li>
            <li>When the brownies are ready, remove the tin from the oven and place in the cold water bath. Leave to cool for an hour before cutting into squares. Store in an air-tight container; they're even better the next day.</li>
        </ol>
