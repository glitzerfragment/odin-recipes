    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Shortbread is really simple but very delicious! Rice flour is the unexpected but key ingredient to get a nice crunch.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Makes about 12:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>115g butter</li>
            <li>55g caster sugar</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>130g flour</li>
            <li>40g ground rice</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat the oven to 150Â° C. Put the butter into a large mixing bowl, and beat with a wooden spoon until soft. Beat in the sugar and salt.</li>
            <li>Sift over the flour and ground rice and mix to a smooth dough; if it doesn't come together, add a little more butter.</li>
            <li>Line a 15cm cake or tart tin with baking parchment, and pat, or lightly roll, the dough into a shape slightly smaller than the tin. Alternatively pat out to 1cm thickness and cut into biscuits and put on a lined baking tray. Put in the fridge to chill for 15 minutes until firm.</li>
            <li>Bake for around an hour (about half that for biscuits) until cooked through, but not browned. Take out of the oven and cut into fingers, slices or squares.</li>
            <li>Allow to cool for a couple of minutes, then sprinkle with demerara sugar and transfer to a wire rack. Once cold, this should last for a good few days in an airtight container.</li>
        </ol>
